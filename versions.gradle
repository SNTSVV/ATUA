	 * MAJOR is increased when breaking API compatibility (only the parts users may depend on)
	 * 	before releasing this there should at least be one minor version (with deprecations if functionality is removed)
	 * MINOR when breaking internal compatibility (i.e. relevant for driverLib and model)
	 * PATCH only for critical bug fixes or when intermediate release is required (for student or reseach milestones)
	 *
	 * Note: strings like x.y.z-RCx cannot be used for dynamic version ranges and thus should be avoided for release tags
